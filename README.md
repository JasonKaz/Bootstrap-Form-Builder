Whats the purpose of this project?
------------------

This project was created to allow PHP to create forms which applied to Twitter Bootstrap's standards without having to manually create a lot of markup.

To Do
------------------

* Move hidden inputs from their own class to a Form class method to create the hidden inputs at the beginning of the form.
* Do something with the Help class, it seems silly to have it in it's own class
* Upgrade to Bootstrap 2.2.2
